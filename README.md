Homework for IoT

For the homework for thursday 14 october we needed to manage a LEDstrip through Telegram.
This document will show how the process of managing that went.

I found a document on google that showed how to install everything:

I followed the steps in the document, but it didn't work right away.

The bot was connected and everything said it worked.
The serial monitor showed that aswell:

The only problem was that the LEDstrip itself would'nt turn off.
